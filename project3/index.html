        <h1>Welcome to Mem!</h1>
        <p>
            You are Mem the Cat, and you must defeat foes in a perilous dungeon with the power of memory!
            Each type of foe you face is weak to a series of attacks, and it is up to you the player to learn those weaknesses. 
            More enemies arise as you traverse through the dungeon, and the threat of time looms over you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mem attacks with the W, A, S, and D keys.
            To help you with your journey, the common Ud can be defeated with the W, S input, and
            the common Du can be defeated with the S, W input. Good luck!
            <br>
